# 1. Alert Generation System

The Alert Generation System checks patient health data in real-time. It uses rules (called AlertRules) that say when something is wrong, like if the heart rate is too high. Each patient has their own list of rules. The main class, AlertGenerator, looks at incoming data and checks if any rules are broken. If yes, it creates an Alert with the patient’s ID, a message, and a time. Then it sends this Alert to the AlertManager, which passes it on to hospital staff. Each class has its own job: AlertRule checks numbers, Alert creates the warning, and AlertManager sends it. This makes the system easy to change later. For example, adding new alert types or sending alerts by email would be simple because each part is separated. The design is clean and good for a hospital system where it’s important to not mix different tasks in one place.
